      <h3>üì¶ Inventory Forecasting & Product Classification for Consumer Electronics</h3>
      <p><strong>Business Challenge:</strong> The client struggled with managing inventory across seasons and had difficulty determining which products should be categorized as Make-to-Stock vs. Make-to-Order.</p>
      <p><strong>Approach:</strong> I worked with over 6 million rows of raw inventory data. I began by cleaning and removing anomalies. Then I conducted trend and seasonality analysis, followed by building a time-series forecasting model. Finally, I combined data insights with market research to create a strategic matrix for categorizing products.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> Achieved 95% forecasting accuracy and provided actionable recommendations to separate MTO vs MTS categories, optimizing production and inventory costs.</p>
